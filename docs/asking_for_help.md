# How to ask for help

We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/) for general questions and [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for questions about your specific code (or grades).
Aside from all the standard UBC policies and guidelines, here are some additional points about how you're expected to use these platforms.

#### General Q&A guidelines

- For general questions, use Piazza. For questions involving your specific implementation of a homework question, open a GitHub issue in your assignment repo. For questions about grades, open an issue in your personal homework repo.
- Do not post offensive or disrespectful content.
- If you have a code problem, include as much relevant information as possible like:
  - your version of Python and relevant libraries
  - your operating system
  - the command you used to execute the program
  - the entire error message
- Ask for help after an appropriate amount of thought and effort.
   - Read all the instructions before asking for help. Don’t ask questions whose answers are on the course website or homework instructions or on the first page of a Google search. These questions take time away from other instructional activities.
   - Don’t ask for help after being stuck for only 10 seconds. Make a reasonable effort to solve your problem.
   - On the other hand, don’t wait until after 5 hours of painful debugging before asking a question. At some point, this just becomes time wasted. This can be exceptionally frustrating if it turns out there was a bug in the assignment (it happens!).
   - **As a very rough general guideline, try to work on something for 10-30 minutes and then ask for help.**

#### Piazza-specific guidelines

- Avoid including answers or partial answers in your question/post.
- Do a quick search to make sure your question hasn't already been answered.
  - you can filter by tags like `hw1` or do a keyword search
- If you post a question and then figure out the answer yourself, please do not delete the question. It's still useful. Ideally, you'd post the answer to your own question for others to benefit.
- When using equations, write them in LaTeX syntax and surround them with two dollar-signs. For example `$$2^x$$` will render nicely in Piazza.


#### GitHub-specific guidelines

- Open your Issue in the appropriate repository
  - If you want the course staff to review/help debug your code, open an Issue in your personal homework repository (e.g., `hw1_goatcabin`)
  - If you have a question/concern about your grades, open an Issue in your personal homework repository (e.g., `hw1_goatcabin`)
- Tag the appropriate people
  - For questions about your code, tag `@cpsc340-2020w-t2/staff` in your issue's text; **otherwise, we will not be notified and won't see it**.
  - For questions about your grade, check Piazza to see if we posted a list of who graded which questions. If so, tag just the person who graded it. If you don't get a timely response (a couple days), then post a reminder and tag the instructor (`@mgelbart`). Again, **if no one is tagged then no one will see your message**.
- Try to make the error reproducible and understandable
  - Include the exact command you used to run the code.
  - Include the entire error traceback, or at the very least the part showing the line number and error message.
- Include a link to the file you want us to review, and a brief explanation.
  - If you want to be extra fancy, you can include a link to the specific line by appending a code like `#L123` to the end of the URL (this would link to line 123). You can also link to a range of lines, like `#L9-L17` to highlight lines 9-17. See, for example, [this link](https://github.com/mgelbart/rhomboid/blob/master/src/run_tests.py#L9-L17).
