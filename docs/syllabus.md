# CPSC 340 syllabus
## Topics covered

We introduce basic principles and techniques in the fields of data mining and machine learning. These are some of the key tools behind the emerging field of data science and the popularity of the "big data" buzzword. These techniques are now running behind the scenes to discover patterns and make predictions in various applications in our daily lives. We'll focus on many of the core data mining and machine learning technologies, with motivating applications from a variety of disciplines.

We will roughly cover the following topics:

- Supervised learning with frequencies and distances.
- Data clustering, outlier detection, and association rules.
- Linear prediction, regularization, and kernels.
- Latent-factor models and collaborative filtering.
- Neural networks and deep learning.

## Prerequisites

 - Basic algorithms and data structures (CPSC 221, or both of CPSC 260 and EECE 320 as well as one of CPSC 210, EECE 201, or EECE 309).
 - Linear algebra (one of MATH 152, 221, or 223).
 - Probability (one of STAT 200, STAT 203, STAT 241, STAT 251, STAT 302, MATH 302, MATH 318, or BIOL 300).
 - Multivariate calculus (one of MATH 200, 217, 226, 253, or 263).

Undergraduate and graduate students from any department are welcome to take the class, provided that they satisfy the prerequisites. If you do not satisfy the exact prerequisites but would still like to enroll in the class, there are additional details available [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340_prereqs.pdf) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/registration/grads-outside-cs).

**Auditing**: because the class/classroom is full, we may not have seats for auditors. If there is space and you would like to audit the course, please contact the instructor.


## Grading
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component  | Weight  |
|-------------|-----|
| Syllabus quiz | 1% |
| Assignments | 30% |
| Midterm  | 19% |
| Final | 50% |

The tentative plan is for all assignments to be weighted equally. The instructor reserves the right to change this in case, for example, one of the assignments needs to be shortened or cut.

## Software

We will be using Python for this course because it is open source and widely used in machine learning and data science.  We will use Python 3 (in particular 3.7 or higher). We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution because it comes bundled with a bunch of useful packages (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebook) pre-installed. You can [download Anaconda from their website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for free.

You will also need a way of compiling LaTeX documents. We recommend [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
## Academic concessions

UBC has a [policy on academic concession](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20190515_V_135_Academic_Concession-Approved.pdf) for cases in which a student may be unable to complete coursework. According to this policy, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include “a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend.” If you would like to request an academic concession, please fill out the [academic concession form](ConcessionForm.pdf) and email it to the instructor as soon as possible. You may be asked for further documentation. The instructor will evaluate the situation and make a decision on whether to grant the concession and, if so, how to proceed.

## Midterm

The midterm exam will take place on October 22, 2020 during class time. The exam is open book, meaning you are allowed to consult course materials, the internet, etc. However, you are NOT allowed to communicate with anyone else in any way during the exam. The exam will be on Canvas and you will have 75 minutes to complete it.

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, or anticipate missing the midterm exam, please see the Academic concessions section above. In most cases, if you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam.

## Final exam

The final exam will be held during the exam period but it will be take-home in the sense that you will have 24-48 hours to complete it (exact duration TBD). The exam will be open book, meaning you are allowed to consult course materials, the internet, etc. However, you are NOT allowed to communicate with anyone else in any way during the exam. 

## Code of conduct

- Do not distribute any course materials (slides, homework assignments, solutions, notes, etc.) without permission.
- If you commit to working with a partner on an assignment, do your fair share of the work.
- If you have a problem or complaint, let the instructor(s) know immediately. Maybe we can fix it!


## A note on COVID-19 from me

We're working together on this course during a global pandemic. Everyone is struggling to some extent. If you tell me you're having trouble, I'm not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you'll extend me the same grace! 

- You're always welcome to talk to me about things you're going through.
- If I can't help you, I might know someone who can.
- If you need extra help, I'm here to work with you. We're in this together.

## A note on online learning from the UBC provost's office

During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0 for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
